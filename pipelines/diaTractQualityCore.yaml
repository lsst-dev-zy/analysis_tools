  Tier 1 metrics to assess difference image analysis (DIA) quality.
  This is designed to analyze the `diaSourceTable_tract` dataset, which
  is a consolidated version of `{fakesType}{coaddName}Diff_assocDiaSrcTable`,
  which is output from DrpAssociationPipeTask on a per-patch-and-tract basis.

tasks:
  analyzeDiaSourceTableTract:
    class: lsst.analysis.tools.tasks.DiaSourceTableTractAnalysisTask
    # This task is designed to automatically run all the relevant atools,
    # so they do not need to be configured here
    config:
      connections.outputName: diaSourceTableTract
