    Parameters
    ----------
    butler : `~lsst.daf.butler.Butler`
        The butler where the data is stored.
    collection : `str`
        Collection within the butler associated with desired data.
    label : `str`
        The label from the `~lsst.pipe.base.Pipeline` associated with the task
        whose tools are to be reconstructed.
    dataId : `~lsst.daf.butler.DataId`
        Identifier for which data to retrieve.
    callback : `~typing.Callable` or None
        An optional function which can transform the data after it has been
        loaded from the butler. The function must take a dict of strings to
        data products, and the DataId. The function must return a dict of
        string to data products. The returned dict is what will be returned
        by `reconstructAnalysisTools`

    Returns
    -------
    config : `AnalysisBaseConfig`
        The configuration of the task run to produce metrics and plots. This
        config contains all the `AnalysisTools` as configured when the task
        produced the data.
    data : `dict` of `str` to `Any`
        The data that went into producing metrics and plots.
