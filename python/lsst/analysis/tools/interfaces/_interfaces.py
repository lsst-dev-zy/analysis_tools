    Technically one could use this for scalars or 1D arrays,
    but for those the Scalar or Vector interface should be preferred.

    `Tensor`\ s abstract around the idea of a multidimensional array, and work
    with a variety of backends including Numpy, CuPy, Tensorflow, PyTorch,
    MXNet, TVM, and mpi4py. This intentionally has a minimum interface to
    comply with the industry standard dlpack which ensures each of these
    backend native types will work.

    To ensure that a `Tensor` is in a desired container (e.g. ndarray) one can
    call the corresponding ``from_dlpack`` method. Whenever possible this will
    be a zero copy action. For instance to work with a Tensor named
    ``input_tensor`` as if it were a numpy object, one would do
    ``image = np.from_dlpack(input_tensor)``.
